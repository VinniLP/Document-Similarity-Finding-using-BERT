# Document-Similarity-Finding-using-BERT
Recently, there has been growing interest in the ability of Transformer based models to produce meaningful embeddings of text with several applications, such as text similarity. Despite significant progress in the field, the explanations for similarity predictions remain challenging, especially in unsupervised settings.
       In this work, we present  an unsupervised technique  for  explaining  paragraph  similarities  inferred  by
pre-trained BERT models. 

## BERT Documentation

We used a  language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.

>BERT is a special  minimum viable product of Natural Language Processing.

## Methodology
- ### Approach 1
    - In this approach, we have just the sentences as inputs to the model , the model encodes it and find the similarity percentage.
- ### Approach 2
    - In this approach, we have first tokenized the sentences and then passed the tokens to the model. 
    - By doing so it helps in increasing the accuuracy of the model.

- ## Heat Map
    - For creating Heat Map,we have broken down paragraph into sentences,to look sentences-to-sentences semantic similarity. 
    
    

## Project Outcome

By looking at a pair of paragraphs, our technique identifies important words that dictate each paragraphâ€™s semantics, matches between the words in both paragraphs, and retrieves the most important pairs that explain the similarity between the two. The method has been assessed by extensive human evaluations and demonstrated on datasets comprising long and complex paragraphs, has shown great promise, providing accurate interpretations that correlate better with human perceptions.

BERT achieved all of its results with almost no task-specific changes to the neural network architecture.
BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtained new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1
